       <header>Schools I Have Attended</header>
       <p id="intro">My name is Sam Berger, and I have had the ability to attend several higher education schools since graduating from high school. The four I have attended are below, I hope you learn something about me and about them!</p>

                   <h2>Oberlin College</h2>
                   <p>I went to undergrad at Oberlin College. It is a small liberal arts school in Oberlin, OH. I studies astrophysics. My first year there the school changed its motto from &quotThink one person can change the world? We do.&quot to &quotWe are Oberlin. Fearless.&quot The new one was terrible and by my senior year they changed it back. Probably the best part is that this is where I met my wife. Fun Fact: Oberlin has the highest percentage of its students marry other studies of any U.S. college or university.</p>

                    <h2>North Park Theological Seminary</h2>
                    <p>I decided to pursue a career as a pastor. This led me to studying at North Park Theological Seminary in Chicago. I spent 4 years doing classes there, although I was primarily an online learner due to my wife's job elsewhere. I made some great friends and what I learned there has served me as I currently work as a pastor. There is a great restaurant next to campus called Merla's Kitchen which serves Filipino food that I loved going to when I was on campus.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working through the curriculum of LaunchCode's LC101 course, which even includes creating this current webpage! I am learning a lot and their learning materials are great. I can't wait to learn more!</p>
